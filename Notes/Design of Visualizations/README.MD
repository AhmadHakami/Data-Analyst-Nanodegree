## The Four Levels of Measurement

In order to choose an appropriate plot type or method of analysis for your data, you need to understand the types of data you have. One common method divides the data into four  **levels of measurement**:

#### **Qualitative**  or categorical types (non-numeric types)

-   **1. Nominal data**: pure labels without inherent order (no label is intrinsically greater or less than any other)
-   **2. Ordinal data**: labels with an intrinsic order or ranking (comparison operations can be made between values, but the magnitude of differences are not be well-defined)

#### **Quantitative**  or numeric types

-   **3. Interval data**: numeric values where absolute differences are meaningful (addition and subtraction operations can be made)
-   **4. Ratio data**: numeric values where relative differences are meaningful (multiplication and division operations can be made)

All quantitative-type variables also come in one of two varieties:  **discrete**  and  **continuous**.

-   **Discrete**  quantitative variables can only take on a specific set values at some maximum level of precision.
-   **Continuous**  quantitative variables can (hypothetically) take on values to any level of precision.

Distinguishing between continuous and discrete can be a little tricky â€“ a rule of thumb is if there are few levels, and values can't be subdivided into further units, then it's discrete. Otherwise, it's continuous. If you have a scale that can only take natural number values between 1 and 5, that's discrete. A quantity that can be measured to two digits, e.g. 2.72, is best characterized as continuous, since we might hypothetically be able to measure to even more digits, e.g. 2.718. A tricky case like test scores measured between 0 and 100 can only be divided down to single integers, making it initially seem discrete. But since there are so many values, such a feature is usually considered as continuous.

When exploring your data, the most important thing to consider first is whether your data is **qualitative** or **quantitative.**
